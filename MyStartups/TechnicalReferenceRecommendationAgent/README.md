## Scenarios

- GIVEN Im coding,
  - WHEN Im using a linux system call, I use it as what I remembered,
    - THEN I want to get some advice about easy-to-misuse points of this system call,
      - AND I want to get some code examples to illustrate the correct usage of this system call.
  - SO THAT I can avoid common pitfalls to improve code quality and reduce debugging time.
  - ALSO Im using some framework/library function, SAME AS ABOVE.
